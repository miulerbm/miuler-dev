# Code

We build a helper function for sorting Posts which have a date property.

```js
export function sortPosts(posts: Array<Post>) {
  return posts.sort((a, b) => {
    if (a.date > b.date) return -1;
    if (a.date < b.date) return 1;
    return 0;
  });
}
```

# Explanation

What this does is using the sort method from javascript, this uses a callback function that returns logical values from a comparison between two items. In short, if a.date < b.date is true, it returns a -1, so a.date is more recent, and a must appear before b. If a.date is less than b.date it returns a 1, so b is more recent and it must appear before a.

<Callout type="message">
  When the comparison returns a negative, it means “a” the first element must
  appear before the second “b”. And if the comparison returns a positive, “a”
  must appear after “b”.
</Callout>

# Further Explanation

Another example, sorting random numbers:

```typescript
export function sortNumbers(numbers: number[]) {
  return numbers.sort((a, b) => a - b);
}
```

In this function:

- `numbers` is an array of numbers that you want to sort.
- The `sort` method is used on the `numbers` array.
- Inside the `sort` method, there's a callback function that compares two numbers `a` and `b`. If `a` should come before `b` (i.e., `a` is smaller than `b`), the function returns a negative value. If `a` should come after `b` (i.e., `a` is greater than `b`), the function returns a positive value. If `a` and `b` are equal, the function returns `0`.
- By subtracting `b` from `a` (`a - b`), you're essentially ordering the numbers in ascending order.

You can use this function to sort an array of random numbers like so:

```typescript
const numbers = [5, 2, 8, 1, 9, 3, 6];
console.log(sortNumbers(numbers)); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9]
```

This will output the sorted array `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9]`, where the numbers are in ascending order.
