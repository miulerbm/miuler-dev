# Intro

In this blog post, weâ€™ll explore how to use the Dropzone library in a React application for handling file uploads. We'll take a look at the provided example code to understand how Dropzone integrates with React to provide a seamless drag-and-drop file upload experience.

## Setting Up Dropzone

Dropzone is a popular library for handling file uploads in web applications. It provides an easy-to-use interface for dragging and dropping files, and it supports a variety of configurations to handle different file types and validation rules.

## Example Code Breakdown

Let's go through the example code provided, which demonstrates a React component for uploading images using Dropzone.

### Importing Necessary Libraries and Components

```javascript
"use client";

import { Progress } from "@/components/ui/progress";
import { useToast } from "@/components/ui/use-toast";
import { useUploadThing } from "@/lib/uploadthing";
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils";
import { Image, Loader2, MousePointerSquareDashedIcon } from "lucide-react";
import { useRouter } from "next/navigation";
import { useState, useTransition } from "react";
import Dropzone, { FileRejection } from "react-dropzone";
```

Here, we import several components and hooks, including:

- `Progress` for displaying upload progress.
- `useToast` for showing toast notifications.
- `useUploadThing` for handling the upload process.
- Icons from `lucide-react`.
- React hooks like `useState` and `useTransition`.
- `Dropzone` and `FileRejection` from `react-dropzone`.

### Component State and Hooks

```javascript
const Page = () => {
  const { toast } = useToast();
  const [isDragOver, setIsDragOver] = useState<boolean>(false);
  const [uploadProgress, setUploadProgress] = useState<number>(0);
  const router = useRouter();
  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
```

The component maintains several state variables:

- `isDragOver` to indicate if a file is being dragged over the dropzone.
- `uploadProgress` to track the progress of the file upload.
- `isPending` to manage the transition state during navigation.

### Handling File Uploads

```javascript
const { startUpload, isUploading } = useUploadThing("imageUploader", {
  onClientUploadComplete: ([data]) => {
    const configId = data.serverData.configId;
    startTransition(() => {
      router.push(`/configure/design?id=${configId}`);
    });
  },
  onUploadProgress(p) {
    setUploadProgress(p);
  },
});
```

The `useUploadThing` hook is configured for the "imageUploader" and provides the `startUpload` function to initiate uploads. It also tracks the upload progress and handles completion by redirecting to a new page with the uploaded file's configuration ID.

#### Handling Rejected Files

```javascript
const onDropRejected = (rejectedFiles: FileRejection[]) => {
  const [file] = rejectedFiles;
  setIsDragOver(false);
  toast({
    title: `${file.file.type} type is not supported`,
    description: "Please choose a PNG, JPG or JPEG image instead.",
    variant: "destructive",
  });
};
```

When a file is rejected (e.g., due to an unsupported file type), the component shows a toast notification with an error message.

#### Handling Accepted Files

```javascript
const onDropAccepted = (acceptedFiles: File[]) => {
  startUpload(acceptedFiles, { configId: undefined });
  setIsDragOver(false);
};
```

When a file is accepted, the component starts the upload process immediately.

## Dropzone Component

```javascript
return (
  <div
    className={cn(
      "relative h-full flex-1 my-16 w-full rounded-xl bg-gray-900/5 p-2 ring-1 ring-inset ring-gray-900/10 lg:rounded-2xl flex justify-center flex-col items-center",
      {
        "ring-blue-900/25 bg-blue-900/10": isDragOver,
      }
    )}
  >
    <div className="relative flex flex-1 flex-col items-center justify-center w-full">
      <Dropzone
        onDropRejected={onDropRejected}
        onDropAccepted={onDropAccepted}
        accept={{
          "image/png": [".png"],
          "image/jpeg": [".jpeg"],
          "image/jpg": [".jpg"],
        }}
        onDragEnter={() => setIsDragOver(true)}
        onDragLeave={() => setIsDragOver(false)}
      >
        {({ getRootProps, getInputProps }) => (
          <div
            className="h-full w-full flex-1 flex flex-col items-center justify-center"
            {...getRootProps()}
          >
            <input {...getInputProps()} />
            {isDragOver ? (
              <MousePointerSquareDashedIcon className="h-6 w-6 text-zinc-500 mb-2" />
            ) : isUploading || isPending ? (
              <Loader2 className="animate-spin h-6 w-6 text-zinc-500 mb-2" />
            ) : (
              <Image className="h-6 w-6 text-zinc-500 mb-2" />
            )}
            <div className="flex flex-col justify-center mb-2 text-sm text-zinc-700">
              {isUploading ? (
                <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
                  <p>Uploading...</p>
                  <Progress
                    value={uploadProgress}
                    className="mt-2 w-40 h-2 bg-gray-300"
                  />
                </div>
              ) : isPending ? (
                <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
                  <p>Redirecting, please wait...</p>
                </div>
              ) : isDragOver ? (
                <p>
                  <span className="font-semibold">Drop file</span> to upload
                </p>
              ) : (
                <p>
                  <span className="font-semibold">Click to upload</span> or drag
                  and drop
                </p>
              )}
            </div>
            {isPending ? null : (
              <p className="text-xs text-zinc-500">PNG, JPG, JPEG</p>
            )}
          </div>
        )}
      </Dropzone>
    </div>
  </div>
);
```

The `Dropzone` component provides the drag-and-drop interface. It accepts only PNG, JPG, and JPEG files. The appearance and content of the dropzone change based on the current state (dragging, uploading, etc.).

### Conclusion

Using Dropzone in a React application simplifies the process of handling file uploads. The provided example code demonstrates how to integrate Dropzone with a React component, manage state transitions, and handle file acceptance and rejection. By following this approach, you can create a robust and user-friendly file upload experience in your web application.
