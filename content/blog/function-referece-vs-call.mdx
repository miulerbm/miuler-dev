# Intro

Let's say we want to create a simple Button for increasing a Counter and we use a useState React hook. Like the following:

```tsx
<button onClick={setCounter(counter + 1)}>plus</button>
```

This will cause a failure of our application, because the event handlers like _*onClick*_ are actually functions or function references, and in fact, `setCounter(counter+1)` is a function call.

# Why this doesn&apos;t work?

In many situations passing a function call may work, but in a lot of them it doesn&apos;t because of how React responds when a function is called. It renders the component over and over causing an infinite loop.

# What does work?

A good example of addressing this issue quickly would be:

```tsx
<button onClick={() => setCounter(counter + 1)}>plus</button>
```

```tsx
const App = () => {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);

  const increaseByOne = () => setCounter(counter + 1);

  const setToZero = () => setCounter(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <div>{counter}</div>
      <button onClick={increaseByOne}>plus</button>
      <button onClick={setToZero}>zero</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

In this code, we have separated the event handlers in different functions. This is how they are defined correctly.
